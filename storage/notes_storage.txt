Notes:

createdAt for users and topics not needed

Soft deletes for messages and also text cleared in order to redact the message

Why are we returning the event as well when posting, updating messages etc. in storage.go? 
- server will implement subscriptions business logic

Likes are implemented as map of sets to easily neglect potential duplicates of likes 
(one user can like a message only once); it also makes sense to have a set of the users that have liked the message

Does from_message_id mean actual message ID or just what place in the topic it has?
- Currently implemented is actual message ID



Maybe implement:

We could implement more fine-grained locks - at least separate for events and messages

Should we add messages like "topic does not exist" in storage.go or server.go?

We could add expiration to tokens in the future
